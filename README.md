# 🚀 Backend Authentication API (FastAPI + MongoDB Atlas)

This backend system is developed using FastAPI and connects with MongoDB Atlas to deliver secure user authentication and file management capabilities. It features signup and login functionalities with bcrypt-based password hashing for enhanced security. The system also supports PDF file uploads, which undergo malware detection before storage—ensuring that potentially harmful content is blocked and users remain protected.

Beyond authentication and storage, the platform offers intelligent features such as PDF malware scanning, context-based search (allowing users to search by content rather than filename), and a built-in chatbot that interacts with uploaded documents. These capabilities enhance user experience and make the app a smart, secure solution for managing and exploring PDF files.
